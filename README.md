## Goals of session

As more and more research comes to depend on the use of high performance computing to
progress, there is a clear need to equip researchers with the basic, practical skills
so they can exploit HPC resources in an effective way. These skills are particularly
important for people just getting started with high throughput and high performance
computing, as they make researchers more effective and make the most efficient use of
resources. Given the success of the Carpentry series in equipping researchers with the
basic, practical skills required to manage and develop their software and scripts
([Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)) and data analysis
([Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)) it is natural to take the
Carpentry approach and apply it to HPC.

In this BOF we will gather input from the experts in the HPC community on the Goals, Design,
Structure and Implementation of HPC Carpentry. We aim to cover the following topics:

* Goals
  + Who are the target audiences for HPC Carpentry?
  + What should the learning outcomes be?
* Design
  + What lessons should be included?
  + How much modularity do we want?
  + How (if any) much site/facility specific material would be needed?
* Structure
  + How long should the course last? Should we support different lengths?
  + Balance of practical, side-along training to lectures

The ideas and discussion from this BOF will be used to produce a public report describing
the key areas of development for HPC Carpentry and this will provide the base for 
the development of the first version of the training. In addition, all BOF attendees 
will be invited to join the HPC Carpentry discussion forum on Google Groups to
continue providing input to development of HPC Carpentry.

We plan to run the first instances of HPC Carpentry before SC'18 and will submit
a follow-on BOF to continue the community development of HPC Carpentry by sharing
experiences from the initial events.
